# React toDo App

A minimalist todo App where you can create, read, mark as complete and delete tasks.

Made with `React` + `Vite`.

Using of [localStorage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to store all tasks and their statuses in browser memory.

Using of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for all app Styles.
